ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Benjamin Lin. I'm a frontend developer with a keen interest in full stack development. I have experience with building modern web applications using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frontend frameworks such as React.

ðŸŒ± Currently, I'm expanding my skill set by learning Node.js, Express.js, Python and its libraries. I'm always looking to learn new technologies and frameworks to enhance my abilities as a developer.

ðŸ’¼ I'm seeking any opportunities that can provide me with real-world experience in web development, mobile development, and software development. I'm eager to apply my skills and contribute to projects that can make a positive impact.
